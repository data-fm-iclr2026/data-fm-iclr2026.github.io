          Welcome to the Navigating and Addressing Data Problems for Foundation Models Workshop (DATA-FM), co-located with <a href="https://iclr.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #C4A484">ICLR 2026</span></a>!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Foundation models (FMs) continue to progress rapidly, with advances in reasoning, multimodal understanding and generation, and emerging agentic behaviors. These developments rely on increasingly diverse forms of data, including large-scale pre-training corpora; post-training data such as instruction, preference, reasoning, and multi-turn interaction traces; aligned multimodal datasets; and high-quality synthetic data throughout the pipeline. As reliance on broad and heterogeneous data sources grows, longstanding challenges in curation, attribution, copyright, privacy, fairness, safety, and evaluation have become more pressing. Understanding and improving the data layer is now a central scientific and engineering priority for the next generation of FMs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building on the success of the previous two editions (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dpfm-iclr24/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DPFM @ ICLR 2024</a> and <a href="https://datafm.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DATA-FM @ ICLR 2025</a>), the 3rd DATA-FM workshop aims to deepen a principled understanding of data challenges across the FM pipeline. We welcome a broad community of participants, including but not limited to researchers and engineers working on pre-training, post-training, multimodality, and agentic systems; experts in law, policy, and economics; and practitioners from industry, including frontier labs and startups. Our goal is to clarify emerging data problems, identify actionable research opportunities, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration toward a more rigorous and responsible data ecosystem for AI.

    <h5><b>Regular Submission Instructions</b></h5>
    <p>
      Regular submissions may be research or position papers. All submissions are handled through
      <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/DATA-FM"><b>OpenReview</b></a>
      and must be <b>anonymized</b> for double-blind review. Papers should be no more than
      10 pages (excluding references) and follow the
      <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/rbgpvtjcnzcj#1d3e6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <b>Overleaf template</b>
      </a>
      adapted from ICLR. An optional appendix of any length may be included at the end of the draft
      after the references.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our workshop does not have formal proceedings, i.e., it is <b>non-archival</b>. Accepted papers
      and their review comments will be posted on OpenReview in public (after the end of the review
      process), while rejected and withdrawn papers and their reviews will remain private.
    </p>

    <p>
      We welcome submissions presenting novel research, ongoing or incomplete projects, manuscripts currently under review at other venues, as well as recently published results. In addition, we adopt the following policies:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>[Submission on previous conference papers]</strong> We allow submissions that have been accepted at major machine learning conferences <strong>within one year of ICLR 2026</strong> (i.e., after May 2025), including papers recently accepted to the ICLR 2026 main conference. However, as workshops are primarily intended to showcase novel or ongoing research, submissions based on previously published work may be deprioritized for oral presentations.  </li>
      <li>
        <strong>[Submission on previous journal papers]</strong> For work published in journals, we leave it to the authors to assess the novelty and relevance of the submission for the community. While the machine learning field moves quickly, this workshop aims to be inclusive of subareas that may progress at a different pace and values contributions that emphasize fundamental and long-lasting research.
      </li>
      <!-- <li>[Dual submission to other workshops at the same time, e.g., another ICLR workshop] We generally discourage dual submission to other workshops at the same time as it would be a waste of our program committees' efforts, and we request an in-person presentation by either talk or poster upon acceptance at our workshop. That being said, as our workshop is non-archival, we leave the final decision to the authors for dual submission. </p> -->
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Short Paper Submission Instructions (3–5 pages)</b></h5>

    <p>
      Since 2025, ICLR has discontinued the separate “Tiny Papers” track, and is instead requiring
      each workshop to accept short (3–5 pages in ICLR format, exact page length to be determined by
      each workshop) paper submissions, with an eye towards inclusion; see
      <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers
      </a>
      for a history of the ICLR tiny papers initiative. Authors of these papers will be earmarked for
      potential funding from ICLR, but need to submit a separate application for Financial Assistance
      that evaluates their eligibility. This application for Financial Assistance to attend ICLR
      2026 will become available on
      <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/
      </a>
      at the beginning of February and close early March.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building on last year's practice, our workshop continues to welcome short paper submissions
      intended to support underrepresented, under-resourced, and early-career researchers who may
      not yet have the means to submit full papers. This track is intended for work at the early
      stages of a project: for example, a concise but self-contained theoretical result, a novel
      observation from preliminary experiments, or a fresh perspective on an existing problem. The
      goal is to foster early-stage ideas and provide a platform for researchers to receive
      constructive feedback and guidance as they develop their work further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Short papers will be peer reviewed. Submissions should be <b>anonymized</b>, 3–5 pages
      long (excluding references), using the same submission portal in
      <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/DATA-FM"><b>OpenReview</b></a>
      and following the same
      <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/rbgpvtjcnzcj#1d3e6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <b>Overleaf template</b>
      </a>.
      In addition, please clearly add a tag <b>[Short]</b> at the beginning of the submission title.
    </p>

    <p>
      In accordance with ICLR policy, <b>AI-generated papers are not permitted</b> in the short paper
      track.
    </p>

    <!--
    <h5><b>Camera Ready Instructions</b></h5>
    <p>Please keep using the same template for camera ready. We allow an extra page (i.e., max 7 pages
    for regular paper and max 4 pages for tiny papers) for the camera ready to properly address
    reviewers' comments, add authors and acknoweledgement information. The accepted paper pdf files
    will be released on openreview after the camera ready deadline. Camera ready draft can be updated
    by replacing the pdf file in
    <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/DATA-FM">OpenReview</a>. </p>

    <h5><b>Presentation Instructions</b></h5>
    <p>All accepted papers are expected to be presented in person. While we aim to provide
    accessibility to virtual attendees of the workshop, we are not planning to provide support for
    virtual talks or posters.</p>
    <p>All accepted papers are expected to have in-person posters, which should be portrait
    orientation up to 61cm x 91cm (24in x 36in) width/height.</p>
    <p>Each spotlight presentation including QA is 10 min.</p>
    <p>See <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/PosterInstructions">ICLR poster instructions</a>
    for onsite poster print services.</p>
    -->

    <h5><b>Author-Reviewer Policy</b></h5>
    <p>
      The workshop program committee plays an important role in identifying and giving feedback on
      up-and-coming work that would most benefit from discussion and visibility at the workshop. To
      sustain our review and program selection processes, we expect <b>at least one author of each
      submitted paper to volunteer to participate as a reviewer</b> for the DATA-FM 2026 workshop.
    </p>

    <h5><b>Large Language Model Usage Policy</b></h5>
    <p>
      DATA-FM 2026 adheres to the ICLR 2026 policies on large language model (LLM) usage:
      <a href="https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/.
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, authors may use LLM-based tools to assist with writing, editing, coding, or experimentation, provided that any such use is disclosed, and that all human authors take full responsibility for the content and originality of the submission.
